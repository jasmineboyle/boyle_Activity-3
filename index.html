        My name is Jasmine Boyle, I’m 18 years old, and I proudly come from Lutopan, Toledo City. 
            I recently graduated from Don Andres Soriano National High School, and throughout my journey so far, 
                        I’ve learned a lot about who I am — my passions, my values, and what truly makes me happy.
        One of my greatest passions is playing volleyball. The energy, the teamwork, the challenge — it all pushes me   
            to grow not only as a player but as a person. I’ve always loved challenges, especially the ones that test my patience, 
                strength, and determination. I believe challenges shape us into stronger individuals. Another thing I enjoy is singing. 
                        It allows me to express myself and connect with others in a way words sometimes can’t.
                            I’d describe myself as someone who lives by the values of kindness, respect, and love. No matter what life throws at me, I try to 
                                 respond with a good heart. I believe treating others well is just as important as working hard for your goals.
                                      If there’s one thing I really dislike, though, it’s rainy days — especially when I’m all set to go to school. It can totally ruin my plans and my mood. 
                                         I’d much rather choose a sunny day, even if it’s hot sometimes. With sunshine, I can do more of the things I enjoy, like playing volleyball or doing outdoor activities. The warmth and brightness 
                                             of the sun just give me the motivation to move and make the most of the day  
                                                  As I move forward in life, I carry my passions, my values, and a hopeful heart. I know life will always have its ups and downs, but I’m ready for whatever 
                                                        comes next — as long as it’s not raining! 
                                                        </p>
